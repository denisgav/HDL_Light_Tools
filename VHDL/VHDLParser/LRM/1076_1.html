<H1>Design entites and configurations </H1>
<P>The <I>design entity</I> is the primary hardware abstraction in VHDL.&nbsp; 
It represents a portion of a hardware design that has well-defined inputs and 
outputs and performs a well-defined function. &nbsp; A design entity may 
represent an entire system, a subsystem, a board, a chip, a macro-cell, a logic 
gate, or any level of abstraction in between.&nbsp; A <I>configuration</I> can 
be used to describe how design entities are put together to form a complete 
design. </P>
<P>A design entity may be described in terms of a hierarchy of <I>blocks</I>, 
each of which represents a portion of the whole design. &nbsp; The top-level 
block in such a hierarchy is the design entity itself; such a block is an 
<I>external</I> block that resides in a library and may be used as a component 
of other designs. &nbsp; Nested blocks in the hierarchy are <I>internal</I> 
blocks, defined by block statements (see <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.1">9.1 
</A>). </P>
<P>A design entity may also be described in terms of interconnected components. 
&nbsp; Each component of a design entity may be bound to a lower-level design 
entity in order to define the structure or behavior of that component. &nbsp; 
Successive decomposition of a design entity into components, and binding those 
components to other design entities that may be decomposed in like manner, 
results in a hierarchy of design entities representing a complete design. &nbsp; 
Such a collection of design entities is called a <I>design hierarchy</I>. &nbsp; 
The bindings necessary to identify a design hierarchy can be specified in a 
configuration of the top-level entity in the hierarchy. </P>
<P>This section describes the way in which design entities and configurations 
are defined. &nbsp; A design entity is defined by an <I>entity declaration</I> 
together with a corresponding <I>architecture body</I>. &nbsp; A configuration 
is defined by a<I> configuration declaration</I>. </P>

</A>Entity declarations </H2>
<P>An entity declaration defines the interface between a given design entity and 
the environment in which it is used. It may also specify declarations and 
statements that are part of the design entity. A given entity declaration maybe 
shared by many design entities, each of which has a different architecture. 
Thus, an entity declaration can potentially represent a class of design 
entities, each with the same interface. </P><PRE>     entity_declaration ::=

</PRE>
<P>The entity header and entity declarative part consist of declarative items 
that pertain to each design entity whose interface is defined by the entity 
declaration. The entity statement part, if present, consists of concurrent 
statements that are present in each such design entity. </P>
<P>If a simple name appears at the end of an entity declaration, it must repeat 
the identifier of the entity declaration. </P>

<P>The generic list in the formal generic clause defines generic constants whose

</A>Generics </H4>
<P>Generics provide a channel for static information to be communicated to a 
block from its environment. The following applies to both external blocks 
defined by design entities and to internal blocks defined by block statements. 
</P><PRE>     generic_list ::=  <I>generic</I>_interface_list

</PRE>
<P>The generics of a block are defined by a generic interface list; interface 
lists are described in <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2.1">4.3.2.1 
</A>. Each interface element in such a generic interface list declares a formal 
generic. </P>
<P>The value of a generic constant may be specified by the corresponding actual 
in a generic association list. If no such actual is specified for a given formal 
generic (either because the formal generic is unassociated or because the actual 
is <B>open</B>), and if a default expression is specified for that generic, the 
value of this expression is the value of the generic. It is an error if no 
actual is specified for a given formal generic and no default expression is 
present in the corresponding interface element. It is an error if some of the 
subelements of a composite formal generic are connected and others are either 
unconnected or unassociated. </P>
<P>NOTE--Generics may be used to control structural, dataflow, or behavioral 
characteristics of a block, or may simply be used as documentation. In 
particular, generics may be used to specify the size of ports; the number of 
subcomponents within a block; the timing characteristics of a block; or even the 
physical characteristics of a design such as temperature, capacitance,location, 
etc. </P>
<H4><A name=1.1.1.2></A><A 
href="1076_1.html#1.1.1.2">1.1.1.2 
</A>Ports </H4>
<P>Ports provide channels for dynamic communication between a block and its 
environment. The following applies to both external blocks defined by design 
entities and to internal blocks defined by block statements, including those 
equivalent to component instantiation statements and generate statements (see <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.7">9.7 
</A>). </P><PRE>     port_list ::=  <I>port</I>_interface_list

</PRE>
<P>The ports of a block are defined by a port interface list; interface lists 
are described in <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2.1">4.3.2.1 
</A>. Each interface element in the port interface list declares a formal port. 
</P>
<P>To communicate with other blocks, the ports of a block can be associated with 
signals in the environment in which the block is used. Moreover, the ports of a 
block may be associated with an expression in order to provide these ports with 
constant driving values; such ports must be of mode <B>in</B>. A port is itself 
a signal (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.1.2">4.3.1.2 
</A>); thus, a formal port of a block may be associated as an actual with a 
formal port of an inner block. The port, signal, or expression associated with a 
given formal port is called the <I>actual</I> corresponding to the formal port 
(see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2.2">4.3.2.2 
</A>). The actual, if a port or signal, must be denoted by a static name (see <A 
href="1076_6.html#6.1">6.1 
</A>). The actual, if an expression, must be a globally static expression (see 
<A 
href="1076_7.html#7.4">7.4 
</A>). </P>
<P>After a given description is completely elaborated (see Section 12), if a 
formal port is associated with an actual that is itself a port, then the 
following restrictions apply depending upon the mode (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2">4.3.2 
</A>) of the formal port: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>For a formal port of mode <B>in</B>,<CODE> </CODE>the associated actual 
  may only be a port of mode <B>in</B>, <B>inout</B>,or <B>buffer</B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal port of mode <B>out</B>,<CODE> </CODE>the associated actual 
  may only be a port of mode <B>out</B> or <B>inout</B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal port of mode <B>inout</B>,<CODE> </CODE>the associated actual 
  may only be a port of mode <B>inout</B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal port of mode <B>buffer</B>,<CODE> </CODE>the associated 
  actual may only be a port of mode <B>buffer</B>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal port of mode <B>linkage</B>,<CODE> </CODE>the associated 
  actual may be a port of any mode. </LI></OL>
<P>A <B>buffer</B> port may have at most one source (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.1.2">4.3.1.2 
</A>and <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2">4.3.2 
</A>).Furthermore, after a description is completely elaborated (see Section 
12), any actual associated with a formal buffer port may have at most one 
source. </P>
<P>If a formal port is associated with an actual port, signal, or expression, 
then the formal port is said to be <I>connected</I>. If a formal port is instead 
associated with the reserved word <B>open</B>, then the formal is said to be<I> 
unconnected</I>. A port of mode <B>in</B> may be unconnected or unassociated 
(see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2.2">4.3.2.2 
</A>) only if its declaration includes a default expression (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2">4.3.2 
</A>). A port of any mode other than <B>in</B> may be unconnected or 
unassociated as long as its type is not an unconstrained array type. It is an 
error if some of the subelements of a composite formal port are connected and 
others are either unconnected or unassociated. </P>

the corresponding component instances are created. In certain cases, however, it 
may be appropriate to leave unspecified the binding of component instances in a 
given block and to defer such specification until later. A configuration 
declaration provides the mechanism for specifying such deferred bindings. </P><PRE>     configuration_declaration ::=

</PRE>
<P>The block specification identifies the internal or external block to which 
this block configuration applies. </P>
<P>If a block configuration appears immediately within a configuration 
declaration, then the block specification of that block configuration must bean 
architecture name, and that architecture name must denote a design entity body 
whose interface is defined by the entity declaration denoted by the entity name 
of the enclosing configuration declaration. </P>
<P>If a block configuration appears immediately within a component 
configuration,then the corresponding components must be fully bound (see <A 
href="1076_5.html#5.2.1.1">5.2.1.1 
</A>), the block specification of that block configuration must be an 
architecture name, and that architecture name must denote the same architecture 
body as that to which the corresponding components are bound. </P>
<P>If a block configuration appears immediately within another block 
configuration, then the block specification of the contained block configuration 
must be a block statement or generate statement label, and the label must denote 
a block statement or generate statement that is contained immediately within the 
block denoted by the block specification of the containing block configuration. 
</P>
<P>If the scope of a declaration (see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.2">10.2 
</A>) includes the end of the declarative part of a block corresponding to a 
given block configuration, then the scope of that declaration extends to each 
configuration item contained in that block configuration, with the exception of 
block configurations that configure external blocks. In addition, if a 
declaration is visible (either directly or by selection) at the end of the 
declarative part of a block corresponding to a given block configuration, then 
the declaration is visible in each configuration item contained in that block 
configuration, with the exception of block configurations that configure 
external blocks. Additionally, if a given declaration is a homograph of a 
declaration that a use clause in the block configuration makes potentially 
directly visible, then the given declaration is not directly visible in the 
block configuration or any of its configuration items. See <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.3">10.3 
</A>for more information. </P>
<P>For any name that is the label of a block statement appearing immediately 
within a given block, a corresponding block configuration may appear as a 
configuration item immediately within a block configuration corresponding to the 
given block. For any collection of names that are labels of instances of the 
same component appearing immediately within a given block, a corresponding 
component configuration may appear as a configuration item immediately within a 
block configuration corresponding to the given block. </P>
<P>For any name that is the label of a generate statement immediately within a 
given block, one or more corresponding block configurations may appear as 
configuration items immediately within a block configuration corresponding to 
the given block. Such block configurations apply to implicit blocks generated by 
that generate statement. If such a block configuration contains an index 
specification that is a discrete range, then the block configuration applies to 
those implicit block statements that are generated for the specified range of 
values of the corresponding generate parameter; the discrete range has no 
significance other than to define the set of generate statement parameter values 
implied by the discrete range. If such a block configuration contains an index 
specification that is a static expression, then the block configuration applies 
only to the implicit block statement generated for the specified value of the 
corresponding generate parameter. If no index specification appears in such a 
block configuration, then it applies to exactly one of the following sets of 
blocks: </P>
<P>-- All implicit blocks (if any) generated by the corresponding generate 
statement, if and only if the corresponding generate statement has a generation 
scheme including the reserved word <B>for</B> </P>
<P>-- The implicit block generated by the corresponding generate statement, if 
and only if the corresponding generate statement has a generation scheme 
including the reserved word <B>if</B> and if the condition in the generate 
scheme evaluates to TRUE </P>
<P>-- No implicit or explicit blocks, if and only if the corresponding generate 
statement has a generation scheme including the reserved word <B>if</B> and the 
condition in the generate scheme evaluates to FALSE </P>
<P>If the block specification of a block configuration contains a generate 
statement label, and if this label contains an index specification, then it is 
an error if the generate statement denoted by the label does not have a 
generation scheme including the reserved word <B>for</B>. </P>
<P>Within a given block configuration, whether implicit or explicit, an implicit 
block configuration is assumed to appear for any block statement that appears 
within the block corresponding to the given block configuration, if no explicit 
block configuration appears for that block statement. Similarly, an implicit 
component configuration is assumed to appear for each component instance that 
appears within the block corresponding to the given block configuration, if no 
explicit component configuration appears for that instance. Such implicit 
configuration items are assumed to appear following all explicit configuration 
items in the block configuration. </P>
<P>It is an error if, in a given block configuration, more than one 
configuration item is defined for the same block or component instance. </P>
<P></P>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--As a result of the rules described in the preceding paragraphs and in 
Section 10, a simple name that is visible by selection at the end of the 
declarative part of a given block is also visible by selection within any 
configuration item contained in a corresponding block configuration. If such a 
name is directly visible at the end of the given block declarative part, it will 
likewise be directly visible in the corresponding configuration items,unless a 
use clause for a different declaration with the same simple name appears in the 
corresponding configuration declaration, and the scope of that use clause 
encompasses all or part of those configuration items. If such a use clause 
appears, then the name will be directly visible within the corresponding 
configuration items except at those places that fall within the scope of the 
additional use clause (at which places neither name will be directly visible). 
</P>
<P>2--If an implicit configuration item is assumed to appear within a block 
configuration, that implicit configuration item will never contain explicit 
configuration items. </P>
<P>3--If the block specification in a block configuration specifies a generate 
statement label, and if this label contains an index specification that is a 
discrete range, then the direction specified or implied by the discrete range 
has no significance other than to define, together with the bounds of the range, 
the set of generate statement parameter values denoted by the range. Thus, the 
following two block configurations are equivalent: </P><PRE>     <B>for</B> Adders(31 <B>downto</B> 0) иии <B>end</B> <B>for</B>;

<P>4--A block configuration may appear immediately within a configuration 
declaration only if the entity declaration denoted by the entity name of the 
enclosing configuration declaration has associated architectures. Furthermore,
